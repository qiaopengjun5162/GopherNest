Welcome to GopherNest – my personal playground for learning Go, experimenting with code, and building small projects. This repository is a cozy nest for Gophers (Go enthusiasts) like me to explore, tinker, and grow.

## About

GopherNest is a collection of Go experiments, tests, and mini-projects. It’s where I dive into the Go programming language, try out ideas, and store useful snippets. Whether it’s a simple CLI tool, a web server, or just some code to understand Go’s concurrency, you’ll find it here.
- Goal: Learn Go, one commit at a time.
- Status: Work in progress – expect chaos, creativity, and occasional brilliance!
- 
## What’s Inside?

This repo is a living project, and its contents will evolve as I learn. Here’s what you might find:
- Tutorials: Code from Go tutorials I’m working through.
- Experiments: Random ideas and tests (e.g., goroutines, channels, HTTP servers).
- Mini-Projects: Small, self-contained tools or apps built with Go.
- Notes: Tips, tricks, and lessons learned along the way.
Check the Projects (#projects) section below for specifics!
